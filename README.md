# Telegram AI Voice Bot

Hey! I'm 18 and this is one of the first real projects I ever built (when I was 17 and bored).
i did every project only and only with my phone, on PyDroid3 and Termux.

The bot:
- You send a text message
- GPT-4o answers
- It turns the answer into voice and sends it back
- It's able to maintain up to 10 pair of last message and replys(for GPT-4.o to remember).

### Demo
*(coming soon)*

### How to run it yourself (it's free)
1. Get a Telegram bot token from @BotFather
2. Get a free API key from https://openrouter.ai/keys (works with GPT-4o for free credits)
3. `pip install pyTelegramBotAPI openai gtts`
4. Put your tokens in the script
5. Run `python bot.py`

- You can set the maximum tokens by changing "m_t" variable.


# Definitely it has a lot of cons to improve, but it was just simple project for me to not to get bored at that moment.

Made with love in 2024–2025
