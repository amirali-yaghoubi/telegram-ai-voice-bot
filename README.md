# Telegram AI Voice Bot

Hey! I'm 18 and this is one of the first real projects I ever built (when I was 17 and bored).

The bot:
- You send a text message
- GPT-4o answers in a super friendly way
- It turns the answer into voice and sends it back

### Demo
*(coming soon)*

### How to run it yourself (it's free)
1. Get a Telegram bot token from @BotFather
2. Get a free API key from https://openrouter.ai/keys (works with GPT-4o for free credits)
3. `pip install pyTelegramBotAPI openai gtts`
4. Put your tokens in the script
5. Run `python bot.py`

Made with love in 2024–2025
